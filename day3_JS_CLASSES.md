ECMAScript (ES) features in JavaScript are the standardized language updates introduced in each new version of ECMAScript. These features improve syntax, performance, and developer productivity. The latest version, ES15 (2024), adds powerful tools like Array.prototype.groupBy(), Object.groupBy(), and enhanced regular expressions.

⚡ Why These Features Matter
Cleaner Code: groupBy() reduces boilerplate loops.

Safer Regex: RegExp.escape() prevents accidental regex bugs.

Better Async Handling: Promise.withResolvers() simplifies promise management.

Modern Date Handling: Temporal API fixes long-standing issues with Date.
