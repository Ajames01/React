# 🚀 React Project Structure – my-react-app

This is a beginner-friendly React project scaffolded with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), designed for fast development and easy learning.

## 📁 Project Structure Overview

### 🔹 Root Files
- **index.html** – The main HTML file. React injects your app into `<div id="root">`.
- **package.json** – Lists dependencies and scripts. Run `npm install` to set up.
- **vite.config.js** – Vite configuration file. Usually left untouched for basic setups.
- **.gitignore** – Tells Git which files/folders to ignore (e.g., `node_modules`).
- **README.md** – This file! Explains your project.

### 🔹 src/ Folder
This is where your React code lives.

- **main.jsx** – Entry point. Renders the `<App />` component into the DOM.
- **App.jsx** – Root component. You build your UI starting from here.
- **Header.jsx** – A simple component that returns a `<header>` element with text. You can customize it.
- **App.css / index.css** – CSS files for styling your components and global styles.
- **assets/** – Folder for images, icons, or other static files.
