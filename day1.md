## What is React?
React is a **JavaScript library** used to build user interfaces for web applications.  
It focuses on building applications using **components**, which make development more modular and reusable.

---

## Components
A **component** is a self-contained section of code that functions as a reusable block.  
Components allow developers to break down complex UIs into smaller, manageable pieces.

---

## JSX (JavaScript XML)
React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript known as **JSX**.  
JSX allows you to write **HTML-like code** directly inside your JavaScript files, making UI development more intuitive.

Example:

## Virtual DOM
React uses a **Virtual DOM**, which is a lightweight copy of the real DOM.  
- Changes are first applied to the Virtual DOM.  
- React then updates only the specific parts of the real DOM that changed.  
- This approach improves performance by avoiding full-page reloads and reducing rendering overhead.
